Title: UTILIZING BIG DATA TOOLS FOR AGODA'S CUSTOMER BOOKING BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC PRICING OPTIMIZATION 

Main task: To analysis the customer demographic by using HIVE.

Tasks:
1.0 Input the file into HIVE table
1.1    Move the booking data CSV file (booking.csv) to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
user@user-VirtualBox:~$ hdfs dfs –put /home/<user>/Downloads/booking.csv /user/hive/warehouse/

1.2    Create a table named booking.
Hive> CREATE TABLE booking ( 
            company STRING,  
            user_name STRING,  
            gender STRING,  
            age INT,  
            origin STRING,  
            destination STRING,  
            flightType STRING,  
            flight_price DOUBLE,  
            time STRING,  
            distance DOUBLE,  
            agency STRING,  
            hotel_name STRING,  
            place STRING,  
            days INT,  
            hotel_price DOUBLE,  
            total DOUBLE,  
            flight_day INT,  
            flight_month INT,  
            flight_year INT,  
            hotel_day INT,  
            hotel_month INT, 
            hotel_year INT,  
            flight_day_of_week STRING,  
            hotel_day_of_week STRING  
            )  
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED  
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  
    STORED AS TEXTFILE; 

1.3    Load the CSV file into the HIVE table.
Hive> LOAD DATA INPATH ‘/user/hive/warehouse/booking.csv’ INTO TABLE booking;

2.0 Analysis the data
2.1     What is the gender distribution?
SELECT 
    gender, 
    count(gender)
FROM booking
GROUP BY gender;


2.2     What is the age distribution?
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age <= 20 THEN 'Below 20'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
        ELSE 'Above 60'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM booking
GROUP BY 
    CASE

    END
ORDER BY age_group;


2.3     What are the customer preferences by flight types?
SELECT 
    flightType,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    ROUND(AVG(flight_price), 2) AS avg_flight_price
FROM booking
GROUP BY flightType
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;


2.4     What is the average spending based on age distribution?
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age <= 20 THEN 'Below 20'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
        ELSE 'Above 60'
    END AS age_group,
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS avg_spending
FROM booking
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN age <= 20 THEN 'Below 20'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
        ELSE 'Above 60'
    END
ORDER BY avg_spending DESC;


2.5     What are the popular destinations by gender?
SELECT 
    gender,
    destination,
    COUNT(*) AS total_visits

GROUP BY gender, destination
ORDER BY gender, total_visits DESC;


2.6     What are the busiest months for flight bookings?
SELECT 
    flight_year, 
    flight_month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_booking
FROM booking
GROUP BY flight_year, flight_month
ORDER BY total_booking ASC
LIMIT 5;


2.7     What is the average flight price and hotel price by destination?
SELECT 
    destination,
