# Project Highlights
- Machine Learning
  - [Environment API Prediction](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Environment_API_Prediction/Environment_API_Prediction_Pulau_Pinang.ipynb): Real-world data of air quality in Pulau Pinang from 2019 to 2023. Perform data cleaning, EDA, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. To identify the most effective machine learning models for predicting API levels specifically in the Pulau Pinang area.
  - [Predicting Hospital Readmission of Diabetic Patients](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Hospital%20Readmission%20of%20Diabetic%20Patients/Prediction%20of%20readmission%20on%20diabetic%20patients.ipynb): Project focuses on reducing the number of diabetic patient readmissions within 30 days in U.S. hospitals by leveraging data mining techniques. The goal is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted based on demographic and medical information. For this purpose, advanced machine learning models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, were implemented to ensure high predictive accuracy.

  - _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

- Time Series / Forecasting
  - [Air Passenger Forecasting](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Environment_API_Prediction/Environment_API_Prediction_Pulau_Pinang.ipynb) This project focuses on forecasting air passenger trends using time series model. By analyzing historical flight data, we predict future passenger volumes and validate the model’s performance using test data
  - [Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Finance%20Time%20Series%20Prediction/1_Time-series%20prediction%20-%20Bitcoin.ipynb): This project focuses on forecasting Bitcoin prices by fetching real-time data using the Yahoo Finance API. It employs time series modeling techniques to enhance the model’s predictive accuracy which include backtesting and rolling methods.
  - [Yahoo Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Finance%20Time%20Series%20Prediction/2_Time-series%20prediction%20-%20Yahoo%20Stock%20price.ipynb): In this project, S&P 500 stock data is collected using the Yahoo Finance API to predict future stock movements. The analysis involves applying machine learning techniques to understand market trends and fluctuations
  
  - [Walmart Sales Prediction](): This project focuses on predicting Walmart's weekly sales using time series modeling techniques. The objective is to develop an accurate forecasting model by using ARIMA and SARIMA models to capture the fluctuations pattern.
    
  - _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ARIMA, SARIMA_
 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
  - [Stock News Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Finance%20Time%20Series%20Prediction/3_Stock%20News%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb): Using NLTK for text preprocessing to analyzes news headlines for stock price movements project.
  - [Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on Steam Game Review with Transformers](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_wqlRSm7-JVUiOpmRGel4DjHf-iI204M?usp=sharing): The Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) project on game reviews leverages Transformer models to accurately classify sentiment at the aspect level. Additionally, LDA topic modeling is used to uncover hidden themes in reviews, helping developers understand key trends and improve game features.
 
  - _Tools: NLTK, Transformers, LDA model_

- SQL
  - [SQL Practical Exam](https://github.com/Marcus53-yong/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/SQL/SQL_Associate_Cert_2025.pdf): The exam assesses the application of SQL queries to real-world hospitality data, focusing on managing hotel bookings, customer details, room availability, and financial transactions. It covers key areas such as data retrieval, aggregation and reporting, joins, filtering, and condition-based queries within a hospitality database system.  

- _Tools: SQL_
